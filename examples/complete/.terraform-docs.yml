  # Complete Example

  Grant access to the AWS EKS cluster by patching the already existing `aws-auth` configmap with the `map_roles`, `map_user` and `map_accounts`.

  ℹ️ The `aws-auth` configmap will already exist when the AWS EKS cluster is created with managed node groups or fargate profiles.

  ```hcl
  {{ include "main.tf" }}
  ```
